While centered on the fey, it includes several other creatures that are not technically fey.\nAs the fey are ageless, the tapestry of debts, tributes, and fealty that has built up between them is incredibly complex. This means that different fey groups do not submit easily to categorization.  Also, many individual fey creatures have, for one reason or another, risen or fallen from their typical place in the social hierarchy.\nThe following is a categorization of the fey into “circles”, as proposed by the human scholar A. C. Doyle.  In Doyle’s framework, a particular species of fey might between belong to more than one circle, such as a pixie counting as both a “Fair Folk” and a “Wee Folk”. Again, the fey don’t use these categories themselves.\nThe Fair Folk include the beautiful humanoid fey: eladrin, fairies, sprites, pixies, etc. The elves were once Fair Folk before forsaking the Feywild for the Mortal Realm.\nThe Courtly Ones are a subset of the Fair Folk that hold titles within the Seelie Court.\nThe Wee Folk include: brownies, pixies, kilmoulis, tomte, house elves, boggarts, boggles, recaps, quicklings, brigganocks, coblyns/knockers, and the like.  Most of them tend to be mischievous, but the more domesticated ones can be helpful if respected and well-treated.    The gnomes were once part of this group before passing into the Mortal Realm.\nGoblinkind include: gremkin, nornkin, norkers, nilbogs, tasloi, gremlins, and other. Goblins, both gobber and wild goblin, have settled in the Mortal Realm, while bugbears move easily back and forth between the two.  The hobs of the Aztlan empire may once have been in this family.\nThe Agrioi include the rustic fertility spirits: nymphs, satyrs, fauns, dryads, nereids, undine, sirens, etc.  These are some of the oldest fey creatures, with deep ties to primal nature and the Elemental Chaos. Like the satyrs, there are some who blur the line with the Faunata, such as the kelpie, selkie, swanmay, mermaid, and centaur.\nThe Hags include the various hags.  Some creatures, such as grindylows and meenlocks, may be wee-folk hags and the harpie may be a faunata hag.\nThe Wildlings include many plant-like creatures, such as treants and many wee creatures that seem to fall between plant and Agrioi in nature.\nThe Faunata include the fey beasts, such as: blink dogs, displacer beasts, unicorns, yeth hounds, etc.\nThere are other additional fey that don’t fall into these circles, such as the doppleganger, puca, and fetch.\nLanguages\nMost fey speak Sylvan.  It is the native tongue of the Agrioi, Wee Folk, Wildlings, Hags, and Faunata.\nThe Fair Folk speak Elvish (Olde Elven dialect), though nearly all know Sylvan as well.  This is the language typically spoken at the Seelie Court.\nGoblinkind speaks Goblin natively, but most know at least some Sylvan.\nThe Agrioi often also speak Primordial.  Hags know many languages, often including Giant (as spoken by trolls and ogres).\nSources\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairy\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classifications_of_fairies - Not terribly useful.\nwww.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/x2r9fl/is_there_a_word_for_nymphs_and_satyrs/\n"},"Fey/King-Auberon":{"slug":"Fey/King-Auberon","filePath":"Fey/King Auberon.md","title":"King Auberon","links":["Fey/Faerie","Planes/Feywild","Fey/Queen-Ceres","Fey/Queen-of-Air-and-Darkness"],"tags":[],"content":"Once ruler of Faerie and the Feywild with his wife, Queen Ceres.\nKing Auberon was killed by his elder daughter when she became the  Queen of Air and Darkness.\nSources\nOberon\nOberon, Auberon, Alberon.

They had twin daughters, one older and one younger.\nOne day, dwarven miners in the Feywild lands of Ladinion discovered a magnificent black diamond deep below the earth.  When they pried it from the earth, they found its faces flawless, with ten polished facets, and its heart impenetrably dark.  They called it the Nightstone, and they hastened to the Court to offer it as a gift to the princesses there.\nWhen they arrived, the King and Queen were busy with courtly affairs. The younger daughter, Queen Titania, was away, swimming in the river.  But the elder daughter accepted the gift.\nYet, when she touched the Nightstone, she grew dark and terrible to behold.  She gripped the stone, the facets cut her flesh, and blood dripped from her fist. She spoke terrible  words of echoing power, and the dwarves fled in fear.\nDrawn by the commotion, the King and Queen hurried to their daughter.  She placed a hand on her father, King Auberon, as he drew near.  Upon her touch, despite his magic and his power, the King was no more. Naught but empty air and a sprinkle of ash remained.\nHer mother, Queen Ceres, quickly spoke words of binding and spells of holding.  As her daughter struggled against the bonds, as the Nightstone glowed blackly, and as the binding spells began to unravel, the Queen begged her daughter to release the Nightstone.  But her daughter, too marveled by its magic and power, refused.  She promised her mother that, with the stone’s power, she would lay waste to all of the Feywild and see it covered by eternal night.\nAnd so, with tears blurring her eyes, Queen Ceres spoke the words of banishment and spells of containment, forcing her daughter and the Nightstone into an otherworldly prison, far from the Feywild. As she passed from her mother’s sight, the new Queen of Air and Darkness swore that the Feywild would never be truly free of the Nightstone.\nWhen her younger daughter returned from the river, Queen Ceres embraced her.\nWith her heart as broken as her family, Queen Ceres no longer wished to rule.\nShe stripped all memory of her elder daughter’s name from Feywild, so that none could call her back.  For their part in this tragedy, however unwitting, she banished the dwarves from the Feywild, and they fled to the Mortal Realm.\nThen Queen Ceres passed her crown to her younger daughter, the new Queen Titania.\nHowever, her elder daughter is not dead.  As a final royal act, Ceres decreed that the Court would be ruled by Queen Titania for 7 years of summer, in celebration of the continuing life of the Feywild.  But then the throne would stand empty for a single winter, in memory of the Queen of Air and Darkness, before summer begins anew.\nCeres is no longer queen, but she can still found at Court at times, a pale and silent regent, standing behind the empty Winter throne.\nSources\nD&amp;D: Monster Mythology (2e, 1992)\nUnseen bodiless form, of the Unseelie Court, in (Phlegethon) Pandemonium.

In Ladinion, a deep sylvan land, dwarven miners discovered a great black diamond and took it to court. Titania was away swimming in the river, so her sister accepted it.

The eladrin are the most prevalent race, but other Fair Folk are present, and some other Faerie creatures have joined its ranks.\nFaerie creatures that either belong to the Court or owe allegiance to it, either directly or indirectly, are called seelie.  Those who do not—whether they actively oppose the Court or simply pay it no mind—are called unseelie.  For example, it is not uncommon for many Wee Folk to respect the Court but not necessarily be bound by it, which makes then unseelie.\nThe Seelie Court cycles through two phases.  For seven years, the Summer Court, ruled by Queen Titania, holds sway.  Then, for a single winter, from Samhain through Beltane, the Winter Court holds sway and the throne is empty.  See the Queen of Air and Darkness for how this came to be.\nWhile many of the Courtly Ones have royal titles—such as The River King, The Crimson King, The Starlight Queen, or Lord of the Hunt—these are always descriptive titles that might by assumed by different individuals over time.

Or you might pass through a Material mill pond to emerge in a quiet forest pond or a rushing river in the Feywild.\nThe Feywild is the original home of the fey.\nThe Feywild is a land of perpetual twilight, sometimes fairly bright, but without a clear source of that light.

Flakes of ash sometimes fall like light snow but crumble to dust when they land.\nMost regions of the Shadowfell are as lifeless as a desert.  There are some exceptions to this, with a few hearty native inhabitants.  Most of its inhabitants are shadows or other undead, though, which do not require material sustenance.\nTime is variable between the the Shadowfell and the Material Plane, but it tends to pass faster in the Shadowfell.

This makes the Shadowfell useful for traveling shortcuts, if you can reliably find your way through it between two Material portals.\nThe fey have suggested that it is the negative energy effect of the Shadowfell on the Material Plane that gives Material natives their mortality. When a mortal dies and their soul fails to pass into the Spirit Realm, it tends to eventually get dragged into the Shadowfell.  Over eons (in comparative time to the Material), the Shadowfell drains the memories, identity, and substance from the soul, leaving only a shadow behind.  These shadows, still hungry for life and unwilling to pass, may slip back into the Material if they discover a means to do so. They will then seek to feed on life energy they find there.\nCreatures that pass physically into the Shadowfell may face a similar fate, gradually becoming darker, shadowy, and eventually undead.
