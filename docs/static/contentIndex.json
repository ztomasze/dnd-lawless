While centered on the fey, it includes several other creatures that are not technically fey.\nAs the fey are ageless, the tapestry of debts, tributes, and fealty that has built up between them is incredibly complex. This means that different fey groups do not submit easily to categorization.  Also, many individual fey creatures have, for one reason or another, risen or fallen from their typical place in the social hierarchy.\nThe following is a categorization of the fey into “circles”, as proposed by the human scholar A. C. Doyle.  In Doyle’s framework, a particular species of fey might between belong to more than one circle, such as a pixie counting as both a “Fair Folk” and a “Wee Folk”. Again, the fey don’t use these categories themselves.\nThe Fair Folk include the beautiful humanoid fey: eladrin, fairies, sprites, pixies, etc. The elves were once Fair Folk before forsaking the Feywild for the Mortal Realm.\nThe Courtly Ones are a subset of the Fair Folk that hold titles within the Seelie Court.\nThe Wee Folk include: brownies, pixies, kilmoulis, tomte, house elves, boggarts, boggles, recaps, quicklings, brigganocks, coblyns/knockers, and the like.  Most of them tend to be mischievous, but the more domesticated ones can be helpful if respected and well-treated.    The gnomes were once part of this group before passing into the Mortal Realm.\nGoblinkind include: gremkin, nornkin, norkers, nilbogs, tasloi, gremlins, and other. Goblins, both gobber and wild goblin, have settled in the Mortal Realm, while bugbears move easily back and forth between the two.  The hobs of the Aztlan empire may once have been in this family.\nThe Agrioi include the rustic fertility spirits: nymphs, satyrs, fauns, dryads, nereids, undine, sirens, etc.  These are some of the oldest fey creatures, with deep ties to primal nature and the Elemental Chaos. Like the satyrs, there are some who blur the line with the Faunata, such as the kelpie, selkie, swanmay, mermaid, and centaur.\nThe Hags include the various hags.  Some creatures, such as grindylows and meenlocks, may be wee-folk hags and the harpie may be a faunata hag.\nThe Wildlings include many plant-like creatures, such as treants and many wee creatures that seem to fall between plant and Agrioi in nature.\nThe Faunata include the fey beasts, such as: blink dogs, displacer beasts, unicorns, yeth hounds, etc.\nThere are other additional fey that don’t fall into these circles, such as the doppleganger, puca, and fetch.\nOther scholars include the Chthonians, which include trolls, most of what Doyle classifies as wildlings, some hags, and various guardians, such as grindylows and kelpies.\nLanguages\nMost fey speak Sylvan.  It is the native tongue of the Agrioi, Wee Folk, Wildlings, Hags, and Faunata.\nThe Fair Folk speak Elvish (Olde Elven dialect), though nearly all know Sylvan as well.  This is the language typically spoken at the Seelie Court.\nGoblinkind speaks Goblin natively, but most know at least some Sylvan.\nThe Agrioi often also speak Primordial.  Hags know many languages, often including Giant (as spoken by trolls and ogres).\nSources\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairy\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classifications_of_fairies - Not terribly useful.\nwww.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/x2r9fl/is_there_a_word_for_nymphs_and_satyrs/\n"},"Fey/King-Auberon":{"slug":"Fey/King-Auberon","filePath":"Fey/King Auberon.md","title":"King Auberon","links":["Fey/Faerie","Planes/Feywild","Fey/Queen-Ceres","Fey/Queen-of-Air-and-Darkness"],"tags":[],"content":"Once ruler of Faerie and the Feywild with his wife, Queen Ceres.\nKing Auberon was killed by his elder daughter when she became the  Queen of Air and Darkness.\nSources\nOberon\nOberon, Auberon, Alberon.

They had twin daughters, one older and one younger.\nOne day, dwarven miners in the Feywild lands of Ladinion discovered a magnificent black diamond deep below the earth.  When they pried it from the earth, they found its faces flawless, with ten polished facets, and its heart impenetrably dark.  They called it the Nightstone, and they hastened to the Court to offer it as a gift to the princesses there.\nWhen they arrived, the King and Queen were busy with courtly affairs. The younger daughter, Queen Titania, was away, swimming in the river.  But the elder daughter accepted the gift.\nYet, when she touched the Nightstone, she grew dark and terrible to behold.  She gripped the stone, the facets cut her flesh, and blood dripped from her fist. She spoke terrible  words of echoing power, and the dwarves fled in fear.\nDrawn by the commotion, the King and Queen hurried to their daughter.  She placed a hand on her father, King Auberon, as he drew near.  Upon her touch, despite his magic and his power, the King was no more. Naught but empty air and a sprinkle of ash remained.\nHer mother, Queen Ceres, quickly spoke words of binding and spells of holding.  As her daughter struggled against the bonds, as the Nightstone glowed blackly, and as the binding spells began to unravel, the Queen begged her daughter to release the Nightstone.  But her daughter, too marveled by its magic and power, refused.  She promised her mother that, with the stone’s power, she would lay waste to all of the Feywild and see it covered by eternal night.\nAnd so, with tears blurring her eyes, Queen Ceres spoke the words of banishment and spells of containment, forcing her daughter and the Nightstone into an otherworldly prison, far from the Feywild. As she passed from her mother’s sight, the new Queen of Air and Darkness swore that the Feywild would never be truly free of the Nightstone.\nWhen her younger daughter returned from the river, Queen Ceres embraced her.\nWith her heart as broken as her family, Queen Ceres no longer wished to rule.\nShe stripped all memory of her elder daughter’s name from Feywild, so that none could call her back.  For their part in this tragedy, however unwitting, she banished the dwarves from the Feywild, and they fled to the Mortal Realm.\nThen Queen Ceres passed her crown to her younger daughter, the new Queen Titania.\nHowever, her elder daughter is not dead.  As a final royal act, Ceres decreed that the Court would be ruled by Queen Titania for 7 years of summer, in celebration of the continuing life of the Feywild.  But then the throne would stand empty for a single winter, in memory of the Queen of Air and Darkness, before summer begins anew.\nCeres is no longer queen, but she can still found at Court at times, a pale and silent regent, standing behind the empty Winter throne.\nSources\nD&amp;D: Monster Mythology (2e, 1992)\nUnseen bodiless form, of the Unseelie Court, in (Phlegethon) Pandemonium.

Those who do not—whether they actively oppose the Court or simply pay it no mind—are called unseelie.  For example, it is not uncommon for many Wee Folk to respect the Court but not necessarily be bound by it, which makes then unseelie.\nThe Seelie Court cycles through two phases.

Gus sits hunched on the coach’s bench seat, grimly gripping the shotgun in his hands.\nFour more gnoll warriors dash from the roadhouse and join the fray.  The larger leader gnoll continues to snipe at the party with his longbow from under the roadhouse stairs and barks orders at his warriors.  After scoring a gruesome kill, Arlo drops to the arrow and hatchet blows, but Numyr leans over him, keeping three gnolls at bay with his shield, and pours a healing potion into Arlo.  Dragging himself to his feet, Arlo stumbles back to the stagecoach to protect Mattie and Gus from a gnoll that has climbed up to threaten them.  Gus’s shotgun goes off with a harmless burst of smoke, but Wayne drops the gnoll with a crossbow bolt as he rides past on Betty.\nMeanwhile, Numyr is wrestling with one of the gnolls, but four of the gnolls now lay dead.  The leader barks for a retreat, and the remaining two break for cover through the roadhouse.  Numyr and Molly—the two half-elves—don’t hesitate to pursue them into the murky interior.\nWayne races around the roadhouse on Betty.  He attempts to hop up onto the balcony as he rides by, but it goes poorly, and he ends up rolling through the dust to regain his feet underneath it instead. Arlo cuts one of the draft horses free of the stagecoach traces and swings up onto its bare back to pursue as well.\nAfter dashing between a couple bunkhouses out back, the gnolls can see a long prairie valley stretching out before them, so they turn to make a second stand in the cover of the bunkhouses.  Molly and Numyr unload on them, though one of the gnolls grabs Numyr while the leader draws a long metal blade and slashes Numyr.  In reply, Numyr disembowels the wrestling gnoll and then drops the leader, who sags back against the wall of the bunkhouse.\nWayne and Arlo harass the last gnoll while Molly bets Numyr she can drop it with a pistol shot. After Wayne lassoes and drags it, and Arlo shoots at it with his longbow from behind the outhouse, it makes a break for freedom beyond the corner of the bunkhouse.  As it breaks into view, Molly squeezes the trigger of her pistol and the fight is over.\nRewards\nXP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmountToForTotal+250ALLGnolls250+5WayneFor the balcony stumble, because we learn more from failure than from success255+10NumyrFor the potion to Alro while surrounded, and for chasing after the gnolls - We wage War to protect the weak and “to deliver them from the hands of the wicked”260+5MollyFor the gambled final shot255+5ArloFor so elegantly charming an exhausted and frightened draft horse255\nDM Story Notes\n\nStagecoach Ride\nGnoll Attack at Chugwater\n"},"Sessions/2025-10-14---Session-2":{"slug":"Sessions/2025-10-14---Session-2","filePath":"Sessions/2025-10-14 - Session 2.md","title":"2025-10-14 - Session 2","links":["Geography/Chugwater","Deadbridge/Buildings/Livery-Stable","Deadbridge/NPCs/John-Ostler","Deadbridge/Buildings/Hotel","Deadbridge/NPCs/Paul-and-Mary-Wilcox","Deadbridge/Buildings/Sheriff","Deadbridge/NPCs/Sheriff-Catherine","Wanted-Board","Deadbridge/NPCs/Sancho","Deadbridge/Buildings/Holler-Saloon","cold-iron","Scenes---Completed/Gnoll-Attack-at-Chugwater","Scenes---Completed/Stagecoach-Ride"],"tags":[],"content":"Behind the roadhouse in Chugwater, the party catches their breath after killing a gnoll warband.\nThey quickly check the bodies.  Passing over the crude bone-and-leather armor and the pouches of dried meat, they find that the leader’s sturdy longbow and one of the hatchets are worth keeping.  Numyr recognizes the hatchet as cold iron, and it bears a likely smith’s mark in a language he doesn’t know.  The leader also wore four shrunken heads strung around his neck.\nThe party then searches the grounds for any survivors. While most of them start with the four rear bunk houses, Wayne hurries alone to the upstairs entrance of the roadhouse and picks the lock.  He also checks the stable.\nWith things starting to look grim, Mattie and Gus call out for Horton, the owner of the roadhouse.  They finally find him emerging through a trapdoor from a small basement shelter in the main roadhouse.  With Horton are Amelia and her two children, who cook and clean for the roadhouse, and Lou, who serves as stable keeper and farrier.\nAlthough shaken, the survivors pull themselves together, put the roadhouse back in order, and make dinner.  Meanwhile, the party buries the gnoll bodies and drags the dead horse away from the roadhouse.  Over dinner, Horton explains that gnolls have been sighted more frequently in this part of Lawless lately, possibly pushed north from their normal lands by the Hob (Aztlan) Empire to the south.  Arlo slips away to stand in the paddock with the horses for a while.\nWith all the roadhouse doors securely locked, the party gets a good night’s sleep in the upstairs rooms.\nIn the morning, with fresh horses from the Chugwater stable, the party completes their trip to Deadbridge.\nThey pull into the Livery Stable, where the horses are unhitched and the stagecoach unloaded.  Wayne arranges stabling for Betty with John Ostler.\nThe party then heads across the street to check out the Hotel.  The proprietor, Paul Wilcox, is of a religious bent, and he seems to warm to Numyr’s knight-like armor and his mention of facing gnolls.  Arlo, Wayne, and Numyr agree to share a bunk room for a dollar each while Molly gets a single room to herself.  Supper and breakfast are included, and supper will be served in about an hour in the hotel restaurant, so the group has some time to check out the town.\nAs the rest meander down Main Street, Wayne heads straight to the Sheriff’s office.  He meets Sheriff Catherine.  She implies that she could use some help, but she is not willing to deputize someone she just met who has unknown qualifications, no history or recommendations, and no previous law enforcement experience.  Perhaps sympathetic to Wayne’s family story, she does leave the door open to something in the future, if Wayne hangs around town and happens to prove himself both upstanding and capable.\nOn his way out, Wayne examines the Wanted Board on the front of the Sheriff’s office. He also gives Sancho the gobber a silver piece for what info he has regarding the wanted Sugg brothers.  While it isn’t much information, Sancho seems eager to prove as useful as possible, and he promises to follow up with any new information he might come across.\nWayne hurries to catch up with the rest of the party.  After considering the festive hubbub emanating from the Velvet Palace, they decide to try one of the quieter saloons first.  They turn north, to one simply marked “Saloon”.\nPushing their way through the swinging doors, they find a room filled with grimy men drinking, smoking, and gambling.  As the conversation falters slightly and heads turn to look at the newcomers, a loud voice cuts across the room: “Why, if it ain’t Armadillo Jones!”\nRewards\n\n1 longbow (gnoll construction)\n1 cold iron handaxe\n\nXP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmountToForTotal+35ALLGnoll cleanup and survivor rescue (10); initial exploration of Deadbridge (20); discovery of Wanted board (5)285+10WayneFor charting the path to deputyhood.300+5NumyrFor charming the locals with religion and might (and gossip)300Molly(upcoming)290Arlo(upcoming)290\nDM Story Notes\n\nGnoll Attack at Chugwater\nStagecoach Ride\n"},"Sessions/2025-10-21---Session-3":{"slug":"Sessions/2025-10-21---Session-3","filePath":"Sessions/2025-10-21 - Session 3.md","title":"2025-10-21 - Session 3","links":["Deadbridge/NPCs/Ernie-Buckner","Deadbridge/NPCs/Clarence-Beaumont","Deadbridge/NPCs/Julia","Deadbridge/NPCs/Mordecai","Deadbridge/NPCs/Walter-Movart","Deadbridge/Buildings/Luskan-Mining-Company","Deadbridge/NPCs/Wilbur-Wainwright","Scenes---Completed/Gnoll-Attack-at-Chugwater","Scenes---Completed/Stagecoach-Ride"],"tags":[],"content":"As the party walks into Holler Saloon, Arlo’s friend, Ernie Buckner, calls out to him.\nThe party joins Ernie at his table and meets his two miner friends, Ralph and Ginty.  As Arlo lays out a mildly exaggerated tale of their recent battle with the gnolls, Ernie orders a bottle of whiskey to celebrate their reunion.\nHoller, the saloon’s proprietor, then approaches Numyr with a smirk and a short rod of cold iron, holding it out for Numyr to grab.  Numyr tries to keep the peace by playing along with this “poke the half-fairy” joke, but Molly steps up with some sharp words for Holler.  When Holler prods her with the rod, she punches him squarely in the face.  As he stumbles back, a handful of the saloon’s customers stand up, ready for a fight. Arlo steps in, jovially talking everyone down.  Holler takes his licking with a snide remark and a show of force by laying his rifle on the bar.  Molly fumes for a while, but soon everyone turns back to their drinks and conversation.\nErnies relates his time in Deadbridge.  He worked as a rancher for Clarence Beaumont for a while, but he didn’t really like the man, or his son, and so Ernie was eventually drawn by the much higher salary offered by the mine.  However, the mine is plagued with several problems.\nFirst, the pale “cloudstone” that surrounds the phi-stone deposits is incredibly resistant to pickaxes and even to dynamite.\nSecond, there is some sort of blight that gradually affects the miners, making them sicken and eventually seem almost dead.  Ernie and his companions look fairly wan themselves.  Most miners now don’t work in Deadbridge for more than a month, though the mining company will offer overtime for those who do.  The most affected miners now congregate at Mort’s Saloon and work the night shift.\nHowever, this leads to the third mine problem: The night shift is now on strike, which has slowed mining progress.\nFinally, the mine is haunted by what the miners have nicknamed “tommyknockers.”  They’ve heard strange sounds and several of the miners have passed out.  Some of their equipment has gone missing, including the special drill bit the mining company recently brought in from back east to deal with the cloudstone.  The tommyknockers seem more active at night or when the miners are working an area in only ones or twos.\nWith the time of their free hotel supper quickly approaching, the party excuses themselves for a while.  After a nice meal  served by Paul Wilcox’s wife, Mary, the party splits up.  Wayne heads out to the stables to care for Betty.  Numyr and Molly each retire to their rooms.  Arlo heads back to Holler’s to catch up with Ernie again.\nErnie and his friends are just finishing up for the night, so he and Arlo take a short stroll. Drunkenly confident, Ernie is still keen to try for the owlbear tomorrow, in order to form a stake for he and his mining friends to head to Caspar.  Arlo gently tries to talk some sense into him and encourages him to return to the safer ranching career, but Ernie remains determined.\nParting ways in front of the mining company, Arlo pokes his head into Mort’s Saloon.  He is surprised to see the advanced state of the blight in the miner’s there.  He meets Julia, the wife of one of the miners.  She provides a little more color around the blight and the strike.  She also introduces Arlo to the saloon’s proprietor, Mordecai.\nMordecai is medically trained from NuDam.  He’s been in Deadbridge since the bridge collapse.  Intrigued at first by the unearthed phi-stones and then by the symptoms developing in the miners, he hung around.  He purchased the saloon from its previous owner, who decided to head west to Caspar.  Mordecai was gradually but profoundly affected by the blight, losing even the front half of his nose to it, but he has not lost his mental faculties like the miners.  He has since become an advocate for the nearly dead miners, organizing them into the night shift.  When Walter Movart, head of the local Luskan Mining Company, decided to cut their pay given their condition, Mordecai arranged a strike.  Movart has not backed down but instead raised his wage for fresh employees.\nArlo bids Mordecai goodnight and heads to bed himself.\nIn the morning, the party plans their day over their hotel breakfast.  They decide to rent some horses and head out to handle the owlbear themselves, to protect Ernie and his friends.  As they discuss horse rental details with Wilbur Wainwright, Wayne notices Sheriff Catherine pass by with the Sugg Brothers wanted poster in her hand.  He catches up with her talking to Mad Mattie and Gus.  The sheriff explains that she’s heard by sending stone that yesterday’s stagecoach was robbed shortly west of here by the Sugg Brothers and some “giant”.\nAs Mattie and Gus weigh their options, Wayne jumps in with a solution.  After some discussion, they agree to delay their trip for a day.  The full party will then join them as escorts, in the hopes of catching the Sugg Brothers and securing the bounty.  In the meantime, they’ll head north to Black Forest Hole to deal with the owlbear.\nRewards\nXP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmountToForTotal+35ALLExploration of Deadbridge (Holler’s, Mort’s, a few stores) and learning of the many problems that plague the mine, lifeblood of the town (cloudstone, blight, tommyknockers, and strike)320Wayne335Numyr335+5MollyFor standing up for herself and Numyr330+10ArloFor preventing a bar brawl that could have landed them in jail; and for trying to keep a friend safe from his own foolhardy bravery335\nDM Story Notes\n\nGnoll Attack at Chugwater\nStagecoach Ride\n"},"Sessions/2025-10-28---Session-4":{"slug":"Sessions/2025-10-28---Session-4","filePath":"Sessions/2025-10-28 - Session 4.md","title":"2025-10-28 - Session 4","links":["Deadbridge/Buildings/Luskan-Mining-Company","Deadbridge/NPCs/Ernie-Buckner","Wanted-Board","Geography/Black-Forest-Hole","Scenes---Completed/Old-Krorg"],"tags":[],"content":"The party stands outside the livery stable with their newly rented horses, ready to go hunt Old Krorg, the owlbear.\nArlo leads them down Main Street to the Luskan Mining Company in order to let Ernie Buckner know they’re going. After finding Ralph and Ginty in the canteen, he tracks Ernie down in the bunk house.  Ernie is a little glum that Arlo brought all of his new friends in on the hunt, as the bounty gets pretty thin when split seven ways.  However, given that it is publicly posted on the Wanted Board, there’s not much that he and his crew can do but grumble.  They quickly get themselves ready and rent some horse of their own.\nOn the ride north to Black Forest Hole, Ernie relates the humorous pants-smuggling tale of how Arlo came to earn the nickname Armadillo.  “Hallelujah! Praise the Lord!”\nWhen they reach the box canyon that is Black Forest Hole, it does not take long to find sign of the owlbear among the trees at the north end.  Among a thick nest of pines, the party finds slashed and downed trees, scattered cow bones and rotting hides, and the stench of death.\nThey tie their horses to a distant scrub bush and approach cautiously.  While most of them fan out, guns and crossbows at the ready, Arlo works his way through the tunnels of tangled pine boughs to the cliff face behind.  He finds a cave entrance there.  It proves to be very dark inside, so he hurries back to Numyr to get a glowing pine cone.\nCreeping his way into the cave, Arlo can hear gnawing and heavy breathing ahead.  Removing the glowing pine cone from behind his hat, he gets a good look at the glowering owlbear.  It roars, and Arlo roars back.  The owlbear charges him, and Arlo sprints back out of the cave.\nWhen the owlbear doesn’t follow, Arlo returns to talk to it, in the way of animals.  Although he warns the owlbear that it will facs a powerful opposition if it doesn’t move along, Old Krorg is unmoved. The owlbear withdraws into the darkness of its den.\nAfter some discussion of smoking it out, the party decides it would be most expedient to just go in after it.  Numyr leads the advance with his illuminated shield, while everyone else clusters around behind with weapons at the ready.\nAs Numyr comes to the first curve in the cave wall, the owlbear lunges out of the shadows on his left. It swipes at him, and, when Arlo tries to stab it in the side, the owlbear swipes at him too.  Arlo sways on his feet and drops to the cave floor.\nThe rest of the party pours bullets and crossbow bolts into the roaring owlbear.  Wayne lassos it, but the owlbear quickly rips free.  Then it turns and withdraws into the darkness.  Numyr calls Arlo back to the battle a quick healing word.\nThe party stalks the owlbear through a narrow natural tunnel.  Where the cave system expands again, the owlbear makes its last stand.  As Ernie and his companions jockey for a firing position behind them, Numyr holds the owlbear at bay while Arlo, Molly, and Wayne fire shots into it.\nFinally, as the owlbear sways from blood loss, Numyr sees his opening.  He dashes forwarded, and guided by the Savior, his blade strikes true.  Blood splatters Numyr, and, with a long roaring groan, the owlbear topples over to the cave floor and breathes no more.\nRewards\nXP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmountToForTotal+130ALLFighting the owlbear450Wayne465Numyr465Molly460+5ArloFor rescuing the armadillo at such great personal risk470\nDM Story Notes\n\nOld Krorg\nBlack Forest Hole\n"},"Sessions/2025-11-04---Session-5":{"slug":"Sessions/2025-11-04---Session-5","filePath":"Sessions/2025-11-04 - Session 5.md","title":"2025-11-04 - Session 5","links":["Deadbridge/Buildings/Beaumont-Beeves","Deadbridge/NPCs/Clarence-Beaumont","Deadbridge/NPCs/Edmund-Lyle","Deadbridge/Buildings/Curios--and--Wizardry","Deadbridge/NPCs/Old-Max","Scenes---Completed/Old-Krorg","Scenes/The-Basilisk-Cave"],"tags":[],"content":"The party stands over the body of Old Krorg, and everyone but the owlbear catches their breath. With a rag from Arlo, Numyr wipes Old Krorg’s blood from his face.  Beneath the blood, his skin feels oddly cool, somewhere between tingling and numb.  The feeling slowly spreads and then subsides.\nArlo leads most of the party in skinning the owlbear, while Numyr leads Ralph through the rest of the cave, looking for other passageways or any precious ores. After Numyr’s comment about the owlbear’s blood, Arlo is not sure whether his own blood-slick hands feel strange or not.\nAt the back of the cave, Numyr finds a steep climb up to another opening about 18 feet up. He scales the rock face, with his glowing shield on his back. He feels a warm humid draft on this face as he peers into the gloom at the top.  He sees three statues of some sort of small wild goblin, along with two glowing pale blue flames. Peering at those flames causes him to feel cold inside. Snapping free of that paralyzing reverie, he scrambles back down to the cave floor and calls for the others.\nWayne tries luring the fire-eyed beast into view with a hunk of owlbear meat on a rope, but it doesn’t bite.  He breaks out his climbing kit so that Numyr can scale the center of the rock face and try to lasso one of the statues without looking into the glowing eyes.  When he has trouble with the lasso, Wayne takes his place.  He successfully pulls the small but heavy chalky statue towards him.  However, at the lip of the cave mouth, the statue suddenly halts.  Instinctively glancing back at it, Wayne finds himself locking gazes with a squat multi-legged thorny lizard with eyes of blue flame. Wayne freezes, feeling himself growing cold inside… but, when he distantly hears Numyr call his name from below, Wayne wrenches his head aside.  He scrambles back to the ground.\nNumyr tries pulling the goblin statue down, but the lizard has a firm grip on it.  It jerks it back into its lair, severing the rope around it.\nAfter two close encounters with the creature, the party decides to leave this strange beast alone for now.  They return to skinning the owlbear, pausing to discuss whether taking a few talon trophies would reduce the bounty value of the hide.  They decide to leave it intact.\nThe hide is very heavy, since many of the feathers along the back are stiff, heavy, and almost chalky.  They work together to get it out of the cave and onto one of the horses.\nThe party returns to Deadbridge in the mid-afternoon, heading straight to Beaumont Beeves.  They meet Clarence Beaumont and his secretary Edmund Lyle. Mr. Beaumont pays them the full $100 bounty.  Arlo offers to work as a rancher for Beaumont, starting in a couple days, to which Mr. Beaumont replies that he would be amenable.\nArlo evenly deals out the reward money to all involved, saving the leftover $2 for a first round of drinks at Holler’s.  On the way there, Numyr stops in at the Sheriff’s to warn her about the fire-eyed lizard, as they had warned Mr. Beaumont. Both of them seem slightly skeptical and fairly unconcerned.\nAt Holler’s, the party shares their hunting tale with the miners there, many of whom troop out to see the hide for themselves.  Drinks and celebrations continue until dinner time.\nBidding farewell to Ernie, Ralph, and Ginty, the party heads back to the hotel for their dinner.  Again, Numyr says he’ll catch up with the others.  He stops at Curios &amp; Wizardry, where he meets the sage, Maximillian Schrodenberger, whom everyone else seems to call Old Max. The old man identifies the lizard as a basilisk and the wild goblin variant as a gremkin, a kind of savage fey goblin that tends to run in packs.  Old Max related the lore that a creature can be unpetrified through a special alchemical solvent made from the basilisk’s bile.  The basilisk is also susceptible to its own mirrored gaze, although this can be unreliable and would likely petrify the bile gland along with the rest of the body. Numyr leaves a couple silver coins as thanks for the information. He also fails to impress Max’s aloof black cat, Ophelia, before departing.\nAfter Numyr relates his findings to the rest of the party over his dinner, they all stroll to Mort’s for a final nightcap.  They get a chance to see the near-dead miners for themselves, and they learn that the night shift strike is ongoing.  Mort agrees that perhaps he should contact a solicitor from back east for advice.\nAfter their long day, the party turns in at the hotel again.\nWhen they wake in the morning, the men of the party  find their chamber pot tipped over, knots in their bedsheets, tangles and knots in their hair, an owlbear feather on the floor, and the word “konsikwenses” scratched on their small wash stand mirror.  Molly has similarly tangled locks and sheets and a feather of her own. None feel that they are fully rested, as if some vague weight now hangs upon them.\nThey wonder if Ernie and his crew might have been similarly affected and whether this will change their morning plans to protect Mad Mattie and Gus’s stagecoach run to Caspar.\nRewards\nXP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmountToForTotal+50ALLPoking at the basilisk and collecting the owlbear bounty500Wayne515+10NumyrFor making a first impression on the sheriff; for opening comms with Old Max525Molly510Arlo520\nDM Story Notes\n\nOld Krorg\nThe Basilisk Cave\n"},"Sessions/2025-11-11---Session-6":{"slug":"Sessions/2025-11-11---Session-6","filePath":"Sessions/2025-11-11 - Session 6.md","title":"2025-11-11 - Session 6","links":["Deadbridge/Buildings/Luskan-Mining-Company","Scenes---Completed/Old-Krorg","Scenes/The-New-Guardian","Scenes/The-Killmoulis-Curse","Scenes---Completed/Sugg-Brothers-Ambush"],"tags":[],"content":"After waking with fairy-locks in their hair, a stony owlbear feather on the floor, and a message scratched on their mirror, the party investigates their rooms. There are no signs of forced entry. As Numyr mends the scratches on the mirror, Wayne notices that, while someone willfully knocked over their chamberbot, they also seem to have tidied up around their wash basin.\nThe party heads over to the Luskan Mining Company to check in on Ernie, Ralph, and Ginty.  They too have fairy-locks in their hair, knots in their bedsheets, and Ernie found a similar owlbear feather on his pillow.  None of the other miners in the bunk house were affected. The three are worried, and Ginty recalls a few stray bits of folklore advice from his Gran, such as the protective benefits of cold iron or a horseshoe hung open-side up.\nNumyr takes a moment to detect any magic in the bunkhouse.  He finds none on the building, the furniture, or any of his companions, but he does find a deep green magical aura on himself.  Bidding farewell to Ernie and his crew, Numyr quickly leads everyone back to Old Max’s.\nWhile the old sage grumbles about being woken up so early, he is intrigued enough to let the party in, provided they fetch him a cup of sweet black coffee from the hotel.  When Numyr describes the signs and symptoms of their nighttime fairy visit, Old Max suggests it is most likely an angry killmoulis.  A killmoulis is a kind of brownie—one of the tiny Wee Folk—that often takes up residence in farms and rural houses.  If well treated, such as with offers of milk, bread, or porridge, they will neaten up the place and protect it.  If angered, they can act out and inflict the house’s occupants with a deep weariness. Given the message on the mirror and the death of the owlbear, however, this probably involves more than just a neglected little house elf.\nOnce Old Max confirms that Numyr has some sort of fey magic on him, he offers to identify its particulars for 10.  Numyr proposes 8, and Old Max is intrigued enough to accept. After a careful examination of the magical aura, the sage is able to untangle a few Sylvan runes.  As he jots them down on a piece of paper, Molly translates them: “my portal guardian” and a name, which she does not speak aloud: Catachthona.\nIn discussion with Old Max, the party concludes that the owlbear was the guardian of a fey portal, working in service to this Catachthona. When Numyr struck the killing blow, the owlbear’s “title” and position of guardian passed to him. They don’t know what that means yet, but the killmoulis (or whatever little fairy or fairies visited them last night) are likely acting in relation to that.\nOld Max says that, given the strength and complexity of the fey magic, he doubts he can remove it.  He might be able to “loosen” it enough that it could be passed on to someone else.  However, the party agrees they should probably learn more before doing such a thing.\nMost of the morning has slipped away by this point.  The party hurries across the street to catch up with Gus and Mad Mattie, who are ready with their stagecoach.  While Wayne mounts up on Betty, the other three members of the party clamber into the coach with a couple of taciturn miners.\nThree hours west of town, they run into the ambush they’d hoped to trigger.  As the stagecoach makes its way around a tight turn between a couple towering rock formations, an ogre steps out in front of the horses and grabs one of them by the bridle.  A curt command, laced with magic, has Gus drop his shotgun while a spectral straight razor floats up to Mad Mattie’s neck.  Then Wilbur Sugg steps into view and levels a small derringer pistol at those inside the stagecoach.\nHe tells everyone to step outside, nice and easy. Wayne nudges Betty forward as his hand drifts down to his saddlebag.  Then Arlo rolls out of the far side of the coach, firing an arrow at Boyd Sugg, the spellcasting younger brother.  A fourth gang member on the rock formation above Arlo shoots a crossbow bolt down over Arlo’s head while Wayne whips his lasso out of the saddlebag and over Wilbur.  A fifth gang member then announces his presence with a sniper shot into Wayne’s shoulder from 200 feet away.  Molly shoots her pistol from the stagecoach window, and Numyr rolls out, scrambling up the rocks to Wilbur.\nAs Wayne jerks Wilbur forward, and Molly and Numyr rain sword blows down on him, Arlo realizes that the spectral razor has slit open Mattie’s throat.  As he dashes to her aid, a wet grey fog billows up around the stagecoach.\nWilbur shouts orders as he ducks back from the party.  The ogre, Grunt, snaps the neck of the horse he was holding and steps around to protect Wilbur.  Meanwhile, Firebug, the gang member up on the nearby rock formation, lights a stick of dynamite.  Arlo sees the sparkling fuse arc through the fog over his head and disappear into the gloom behind him with a thump. It sounds like it landed on the stagecoach.  “Gus, dynamite on the stage!” he yells.  When Gus’s reply does not inspire confidence, Arlo dives after it, snatches the dynamite stick off the roof the stage, and wings it off in Boyd’s direction.\nThere is a boom, and then Boyd’s startled voice in reply: “Firebug, watch it with the dynamite!”\n“Sorry, I’ll try again,” Firebug shouts back.\nBut before he can, Wilbur slips behind the blocking ogre and stumbles away from the party into the fog.\nRewards\nXP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmountToForTotal+20ALLLearning more about their owlbear situation, Numyr’s new condition, and hunting down the Sugg brothers520Wayne535Numyr545+5MollyFor translating Sylvan, yet knowing not to unnecessarily speak a fey name aloud535+5ArloFor some Big Damn Hero moments: saving Mad Mattie and throwing back the dynamite545\nDM Story Notes\n\nOld Krorg\nThe New Guardian\nThe Killmoulis Curse\nSugg Brothers Ambush\n"},"Sessions/2025-12-02---Session-7":{"slug":"Sessions/2025-12-02---Session-7","filePath":"Sessions/2025-12-02 - Session 7.md","title":"2025-12-02 - Session 7","links":["Geography/Ogallah","Scenes---Completed/Sugg-Brothers-Ambush"],"tags":[],"content":"Bullets fly in the shootout with the Sugg Brothers gang.\nAs Wilbur Sugg stumbles away from the magical fog cloud, Wayne squeezes his way between the ogre and the stamping horses to shoot Wilbur in the back. But then the ogre lays Wayne out with his club, while Boyd Sugg calls his brother back to consciousness with a healing word.\nAs Firebug launches a second stick of dynamite onto the roof of the stagecoach, Arlo scrambles up the rocky cliff to face him.  Gus tosses the dynamite from the roof into the ravine behind the stagecoach.  The explosion rocks the coach and panics the horses even further.  However, despite their struggling, the dead horse in the traces keeps them from moving far.  Mad Mattie hauls on the reigns with blood hands.\nNumyr gets Wayne back up again and covers him from a second staggering blow from the ogre.  Molly slashes at the ogre’s knees, and he roars at her to “stop hurting!”  When the party suggests he could stop hurting people first, he pauses to think it over… but Numyr runs him through before the ogre can conclude the thought.\nWayne pushes himself to his feet and stumbles after the Sugg brothers, dropping Wilbur with another shot.  Meanwhile, high on the rocky cliff, Arlo slashes at Firebug with his machetes, deflects a return shove from the outlaw, and then cuts Firebug open down the back when Firebug tries to break for low ground.  With a slip and tumble, Arlo slides down the rocky face again to head off the Sugg brothers.\nAfter slashing Boyd, Arlo levels his second blade at Body’s neck and calls for the outlaw’s surrender.  Wayne steps up behind Arlo, levels his crossbow at Boyd, and adds that they’ll let him heal his brother if he surrenders.\nBoyd weighs his options against two opponents, plus two more emerging from the fading fog cloud. He raises his hands in surrender and mutters a final word to heal his brother.  Behind Boyd, the party sees the sniper slide down from his distant stony perch and start running.\nWayne quickly manacles the Sugg brothers.  The party searches them, confiscating their weapons and coins.  Boyd carried a pearl-handed straight razor, and his hands are covered with many thin white scars, old and new.  The party catches their breath and checks on Mattie and Gus.  Wayne slips them both some money as he regrets the danger he put them in. The party drags the dead horse and the ogre off the road, stows Firebug’s body on the baggage rack on the roof of the coach, and ties Wilbur and Boyd’s manacles to the back.  They then make a slow return to Deadbridge.\nBack at town, Gus and Mattie unload the stage, with hopes to try for Caspar again tomorrow.  The party escorts their prisoners to Sheriff Catherine.  She nods to Wayne, recognizes Numyr, and greets the other two members of the party.  After stowing the prisoners in the small jail cell, she listens to the story of their capture.  She then leads the party to the post office where she can lay her hands on sufficient coin to pay them the $200 bounty.  She gives Wayne another nod, and returns to her office to question the prisoners.  They’ll be sent east to Ogallah soon on another stage coach.\nThe party steps out onto the boardwalk.  As the sun dips toward the horizon, they discuss their potential next steps.  As they do, Old Max steps out of the apothecary across the street.  He spots Numyr and waves him over. Old Max explains that he’s been conferring in the abstract about Numyr’s case with a colleague. He asks if he might have Numyr’s leave to share more specific details, “particularly regarding the basilisk.”\nWhen Numyr agrees, Old Max leads him back into the apothecary, and the rest of the party follows them in.\nRewards\nXP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmountToForTotal+200ALLCapturing the Sugg brothers720+10Waynefor looking after Gus and Mad Mattie; for a second positive impression on the sheriff (score is rising there)745Numyr745Molly735Arlo745\nDM Story Notes\n\nSugg Brothers Ambush\n"},"Wanted-Board/Completed/Owlbear-Bounty":{"slug":"Wanted-Board/Completed/Owlbear-Bounty","filePath":"Wanted Board/Completed/Owlbear Bounty.md","title":"Owlbear Bounty","links":["Geography/Black-Forest-Hole","Deadbridge/NPCs/Clarence-Beaumont","Deadbridge/Buildings/Beaumont-Beeves"],"tags":[],"content":"Written in a firm, stately hand:\n\nOwlbear Bounty\nThe owlbear known as Old Krorg has eaten its last beef.\nIt lairs in the woods of Black Forest Hole six miles north of town.\nI will pay $50 if you can prove you killed it,\nor $100 if you bring me its full pelt.\nClarence Beaumont\nBeaumont Beeves\n"},"Wanted-Board/Completed/Wanted---Wilbur-Sugg":{"slug":"Wanted-Board/Completed/Wanted---Wilbur-Sugg","filePath":"Wanted Board/Completed/Wanted - Wilbur Sugg.md","title":"Wanted - Wilbur Sugg","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"This notice is printed on sturdy card stock.
